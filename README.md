# React Native Learning Journey 🚀📱

Welcome to my **React Native Learning Repository**! 🎉 This is where I take on the challenge of **React Native**, one bug at a time (and trust me, there are plenty). If you've ever wanted to see a developer go from "What is this?" to "Oh, I got this!", you're in the right place. 

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo is a chaotic yet organized collection of my projects, experiments, and random notes as I conquer the world of **React Native**. If something breaks, well... it's all part of the learning process, right? 😅

## 🚀 Technologies & Tools

- **React Native**: The hero of the story
- **TypeScript**: Because I enjoy making my life slightly harder
- **Redux**: Keeping state management from turning into a nightmare
- **React Navigation**: So users don't get lost (hopefully)
- **Axios**: Fetching data like a pro
- **Jest**: For when I finally write tests
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Making sure my code doesn’t look like spaghetti 🍝
- **Firebase**: Because I need a backend that just works

## 💡 How to Use This Repository? (AKA How to Avoid Breaking Things)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-yadav-12/React-Native.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```sh
   cd React-Native
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the application**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

(If something goes wrong, try turning it off and on again. Works 90% of the time.)
